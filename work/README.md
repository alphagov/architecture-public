> How do you get to Carnegie Hall?

### Characteristics of architects:

* Systems Thinkers
* Being a salesperson 
* Comfortable being a lone voice/maverick..
* An ability to rapidly context switch. 
* Curious. 
* Fast learner / good listener / translator. 
* Able to zoom in/out
* Good with numbers
* Conscious of future

They

* look after the map of services, current and future
* work with more than one service, department, project…
* …focus on building shared understanding - sharing of code data, patterns, ...
* focus on pipelines: cost, usability and security - to give us the right technical assurance


### Way of working

* architects are responsible for improving the government service landscape as a whole
 above, but not instead of, the needs of individual services

(it isn’t a conflict - focus on sharing - most problems have been seen before or will be seen again)

* all architecture work is placed into a single backlog
  
  (including work that isn’t strictly part of the groups’ core responsibility)

* architects are empowered to make decisions about their time
  
  (‘pull’ work from the backlog) 
  (‘push’ work into the backlog) 

* architect work priorities are set against defined vision, roadmap and risk model
  
  (the group curates the vision, roadmap and risk)
  (the group estimates and prioritises)
  (we look for stress points!)

* our workload and priorities are open to all service and delivery managers

  ( many people will have a lot to say about the roadmap, the relative value and risk from which we prioritise!)
